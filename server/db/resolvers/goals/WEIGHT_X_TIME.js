/**
 * Measures progress towards a weight Ã— time goal.
 * @param {number} goalWeight - Target weight in kilograms.
 * @param {number} goalTime - Target time in seconds.
 * @param {number} goalSets - sets of this to do... How many sets for time to repeat...
 * @param {boolean} goalIsFast - True if less time is better, false if more time is better.
 * @param {number} weightUsed - Actual weight lifted by the user.
 * @param {number[]} timePerSet - Actual time (in seconds) taken by the user each set. The length of this array is the numbers of total sets done...
 * @returns {number} Progress score between 0 and 1.
